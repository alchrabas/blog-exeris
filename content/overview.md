Summary: Overview of ideas, features and mechanics which will exist in Exeris

Hello. For quite a long time I thought I'll go without a blog, but now I've decided to give it a try.
The main reason is the fact that forum is not yet publicly available and it must wait, because I want to connect forum and in-game accounts. Everything's for your comfort ;)

On this blog I'd like to explain things which aren't properly explained on the front page and present the game features in a form interesting for a player, without going into internals.

First of all, I'd like to describe ideas and mechanics which make Exeris a **crafting** and an **exploration** game.

# Crafting
The core element of a crafting game is building or manufacturing tools or structures, which help in producing other things.

Exeris is a sandbox with almost unlimited freedom of choice, where you can travel across the map, get and use resources to create structures or destroy them.

## Resources (stackable items)
A character you control will be able to gather materials of many different groups, like stone, wood, gold or coal.
To encourage customization of the items, there are multiple resources which are interchangeable in the group, for example:

 - oak, willow or pine for **wood**
 - sandstone or granite for **stone**
 - potatoes, beetroots or cucumbers for **vegetables**

The amount of every resource of the group to fulfill the requirements for manufacturing can vary. It's a quite complex system which is already complete and will be explained more thoroghly in the future.

*Resources* is just a common name for items that are *stackable*, which means if you drop one in place where there's already one on the ground then it *stacks* onto the first one and they are shown as a single entry showing quantity, for example:

 - 2 oak branches
 - 11 carrots

The example above shows how all items with quantity of more than one are presented. All stacked items consist of the finite number of indivisible objects.
By the way it also revals that stackable items of the same type are exactly the same - they don't have any individual properties, which is different from the rest of items, which are called **non-stackable items**.

There's one exception from this rule - some of the stackable items can be enhanced by adding some other resources chosen by the player. This way it's possible to drastically expand creativity of cooking recipes without zillions of predefined options. For example sandwiches can be enhanced using various foods to create the following variations:

 - 3 sandwiches with cheese and ham
 - 5 sandwiches with carrots, garlic and sausage
 - a sandwich with boiled potatoes and salt

## Non-stackable items
Most of items are not stackable, which means they can have individual properties like quality, damage or used material. This allows to give player an ability to sew a shirt using any cloth and get a shirt of specific fabric. It will be explained thoroughly in an entry concerning the **recipes**.

Every non-stackable item has a quality, which is based on skill of manufacturer and quality of the tools and machines used.

## Other entities
There are also other entities: buildings, vehicles, passages inside of buildings or roads which can be built to form the environment of your characters in the way you like.

# Exploration
Exploration is as important as crafting, so much effort was spent to make it fun and interesting.

The whole idea of the Old and New World is to give *everyone* a chance to explore. If the world were static, then soon all its parts would be explored and the world would lose the sense of novelty. The New World perpetually disappearing and regenerating will provide a constant challenge for every ambitious adventurer.

By going to the New world - full of valuable resources, wild animals and abandoned treasures - you need to prove your skills to be able to survive in this unfriendly environment.

As the Old and New world are separated by the ocean, the only way of travelling and trading is sailing.
The comprehensive sailing system offers another challenge for people who feel like being a seahawk. The wind and sea currents require supreme navigation skills to reach the safe haven.

# Conclusion
The comprehensive item crafting system and clever incentives to explore the unknown lands teamed up with the different tiny features with slow and consistent gameplay offer a unique experience where you can become a smith, a trader, a guard, a pirate, a woodcutter, a townsleader or anybody you like.
