Summary: Why Exeris beta1 is not ready yet?


In the previous post I've given ETA of the first beta. I was very consistent until then about not posting any (even approximate) dates. I did it once and I failed to meet it. So I'll need to change my strategy.

# What is done?
I was quite busy in Q1 of 2017 and I have managed to do almost everything I've planned. My time limitations are not going to change in the near future.

Most of the work I've done for Exeris was the frontend. It's almost fully working. It's still not in its final form, as I mostly use placeholder icons, I don't focus on proper styling etc. but it's pretty close to the one I'd like to present. And, so far, everything works well only on desktop.

# What is needed to reach beta1?
I've decided to not try promising another approximate date, but rather a list what exactly I have to do before the release.

The list is as follows:

 - add missing JS tests for parts of frontend which are currently not testable
 - add full i18n for static texts in frontend (to make it work for languages other than English)
 - make UI mobile-friendly to work well on mobile phones and tablets

# What then?
To reach beta2, which I hope to be close to the first official release, I'd like to focus mostly on:

 - creating a map generator. If it'll be good enough then **The old world** that will be generated will stay in 1.0 release
 - creating a web interface for managing the game entities, e.g. defining item types, animals or recipes. There's going to be lots of these, so it must be both powerful and easy to use

# Conclusion
That will not be the end of the new features. Creating a visually appealing map presentation is an important milestone, but I intentionally delay that, because it can be added any moment without affecting the gameplay.

I've spent a lot of time analyzing the game aspects which can make Exeris game live longer, but I'm sure that even more will have to be learned experimentally during the beta tests.
Theoretical knowledge will make it significantly easier to come up with the correct solutions, but most of the work will be getting feedback from the players and tuning the game elements accordingly to make sure the game will be appealing both for new players and the ones who joined the game right in the beginning.

Even after releasing beta2 there will be lots of important things to do and many things can get added or changed before the 1.0 release.
