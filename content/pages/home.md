Exeris is an open-source, free, browser-based multiplayer mix of crafting and exploration game.
It's being actively developed and it's not finished yet.

The game's main features are:

 - **being able to be extremely challenging**
 - **self-managing** (not requiring much manual administration)
 - not **time-restricted** (open-end)
 - **slow paced** with **elastic time requirements** (good for busy people)
 - **full of surprises**


Gameplay
========
By playing a character in the virtual world consisting of two main continents it's possible to cooperate
or compete with characters of other players to collect resources and use them to build or craft
more advanced tools, machines, buildings or ships.

There are two main continents in the game, which are called **Old** and **New World**.

**The Old World** is a persistent group of islands where most of the new players start.
It's not very rich or large, but it's relatively safe to live there and easy to prepare basic tools.

The most wealthy and fertile area is **The New World** - a land ready to be explored and settled to get its riches.
On the other hand, **The New World** is not durable and, after certain period of time (about a year) **The New World** sinks in the ocean.
After a few days a completely new **New World** continent is created and emerges from the ocean, ready to be explored and exploited.

Apart of that, almost every entity in the game needs to be built by players and it requires maintenance to work.  
Tools or machines need to be repaired or they degrade until they turn into a pile of rubbish.  
Food cannot be stored permanently, it starts to decay some time after it's produced.  
When the environment created by players is abandoned, then it slowly comes back to its original state.  
When a character dies, then their death is permanent and they cannot be revived in any way.  


Plans
=====
There is no goal to run pre-alpha version of the game as soon as possible.
Most of the backend code is validated by automatic tests, so there's no need to have a running game server.

There is no planned release date.
